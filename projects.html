					<b>Illuvë (Mar. 2016 - Apr. 2016, CMU) [Django, Python, Javascript]</b> <br/>
					This is the final team project from the course 15-437 Web Application Application. Illuvë is a multiplayer web tank game.
					A player can register a new account through his or her email and password. Once a player confirms his or her registration, he or she 
					can log in to join the fun competition and fight battles against others. The basic idea is to fire at your opponents and 
					dodge the bullets from others. Players who destroy more tanks will rank higher in the scoreboard and get some reward points 
					that can be used to upgrade the speed and the power of their tanks, and even change their appearance sometimes!

					<b>Lucas-Kanade, Matthew-Baker and Mean-Shift Trackers (Apr. 2016, CMU) [MATLAB]</b> <br/>
					The Lucas-Kanade tracker assumes we already have a good initialization of the template and a close estimate p of
					the correct warp, and it needs to find the small linear change, delta p, that minimizes the pixel-wise sum of
					square difference between the warped image and the template. The Matthew-Baker tracker improves upon the Lucas-Kanade 
					tracker by warping both the image and the template, which makes it possible to compute the Jacobian and Hessian matrix 
					of the template only once. Compared to Lucas-Kanade tracker, mean-shift tracker can deal with objects with more deformation
					in its appearance. It achieves this by utilizing the histogram of the template to compute the weights for each pixel 
					and finally calculating the mean-shift vector.

					<b>3D Reconstruction by Triangulation and Stereo Rectification (Apr. 2016, CMU) [MATLAB]</b> <br/>
					There are two parts in this project: sparse reconstruction and dense reconstruction. For the sparse reconstruction,
					it first computes the fundamental matrix by eight point algorithm, and then it gets epipolar correspondence and
					the essential matrix using fundamental matrix. Finally, it triangulates pairs of 2D points in the images to a set of
					3D points and select the correct projection matrix. For the dense reconstruction, it first rectifies the images to 
					make the epipolar line horizontal. Then, it computes disparity map and depth map and eventually, plots the result
					in 3D.

					<b>Augmented Reality Application using Planar Homographies (Mar. 2016, CMU) [MATLAB]</b> <br/>
					This project first find point pairs between an image pair by finding salient points using FAST 
					(Features from Accelerated Segment Test) detector and extracting feature descriptors using BRIEF
					(Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features). Then it estimates and normalizes planar homography from these point pairs
					and run RANSAC (RANdom SAmple Consensus) algorithm to reduce mismatches. Finally, it implements an AR application by tracking
					a book in each frame of a target video and overlaying each frame from the source video (Kung Fu Panda) onto the book in the
					target video.

					<b>Scene Classification System with Bag of Visual Words (Mar. 2016, CMU) [MATLAB]</b> <br/>
					This project classifies images into 8 scene categories from the SUN Image database. It consists of 3 parts.
					In the first part, the program samples some points in each images and converts the pixels into high dimensional representations
					and then runs k-means algorithm to produce a visual words dictionary. In the second part, it assigns every pixel in the images
					to its closest visual word in the dictionary and extracts the histogram of visual words within each image. In the third part, 
					it evaluates the classification system with test images by kNN (k Nearest Neighbors) algorithm.

					<b>Edge Detection by Hough Transform (Feb. 2016, CMU) [MATLAB]</b> <br/>
					This project detects edges in different images. It first applies Gaussian filters to reduce noise and spurious fine edges
					in the image. Then it computes the image gradients in both horizontal and vertical direction using Sobel filters. To preserve
					the best line and discard the similar ones, it uses non-maximum suppression. Then, it calculates Hough transform to obtain 
					the number of 'votes' for all the possible lines passing through the image. Finally, find the n lines with the highest votes
					from Hough transform to get the final result.

					<b>Parallel PCA Applied to Surveillance Video (Dec. 2015 - Jan. 2016, NCTU) [C++, OpenMP]</b> <br/>
					This is my final project from the course Parallel Programming. When PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is applied to videos,
					it can extract the principal components and separate the static background (principal components) from the moving objects (residuals).
					This project reduced 54% of total execution time (including processing the input and the output of the program) using one-sided Jacobi
					method and tall-and-skinny SVD (Singular Value Decomposition).

					<b>Monopoly (Apr. 2014 - Jun. 2014, NCTU) [Java]</b> <br/>
					This is the final team project from the course JAVA Programming. Monopoly is a game where player compete to buy and upgrade estates
					to collect rent from others. The ultimate goal for each player is to become the richest player and make all other players
					go bankrupt. In each round, a player first roll the dice to determine where to go, and therefore will encounter different
					events according to the type of the destinations, such as land owned by that player himself or herself, land owned by other player, 
					terra nullius (land that is not owned by anyone), banks, vehicle stores, and Chance or Community Chest spots.
